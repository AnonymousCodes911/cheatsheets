Inheritance in Java	Types of Inheritance in Java language	19-10-2022	19-10-2022	-
 
Inheritance - It is the property of a child/derived/subclass, allowing it to inherit the properties() and functionalities or data members methods from its parent/base/superclass.  
Java supports 4 types of inheritance: 
1.	Single Inheritance
2.	Multi-level Inheritance
3.	Hierarchical Inheritance
4.	Hybrid Inheritance 
Single Inheritance : 
As the title indicates, just one class is subject to this kind of inheritance. The parent class gives rise to just one child class. 

Syntax: 
Class A{
  //your parent class code
}
Class B extends A {
   //your child class code
}
 
Multi-Level Inheritance:  
In multi-level inheritance, one class has more than one parent class but at different levels of inheritance.  

Syntax: 
Class A{
  //your parent class code
}
Class B extends A {
   //your code
}
Class C extends B {
    //your code 
}
 
Hierarchical Inheritance
 In hierarchical inheritance, one parent can have one or more child/sub/derived classes.
      
Syntax: 

Class A{
  //your parent class code
}
Class B extends A {
   //your child class code
}
Class C extends A {
    //your child class code 
}
 
Hybrid Inheritance: 
Hybrid Inheritance is the combination of more than one type of inheritance in a single program. 
 
 
NOTE- 
Multiple inheritance is not supported in Java as it leads to the diamond problem. 
We can achieve Multiple inheritance in Java by using the concept of Abstraction.
